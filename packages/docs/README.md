## NOTE?: Do we want to require users to "register" for an API key from us before using the SDK?

## LivelyDiamond's Goal

Here is where we explain why we started creating our contracts. We wanted there to be an easy, affordable, modular way for artists to use NFTs to engage with their fans. This can be as technical or light as needed.

## LivelyDiamond's Overview

The LivelyDiamond ecosystem is a collection of on chain smart contracts (LivelyFacets) and web development SDKs to make interacting with them as easy as possible. The smart contracts were built modularly using the [ERC-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) standard. This allows you to only use the features you want, upgrade your contract in the future to use more features, and keep costs down for you as a deployer. We handle all the heavy lifting.

## LivelyDiamond's Features

When you create a LivelyDiamond, you can make it as an ERC-721A collection or an ERC-1155 compliant collection. Both also are [EIP-173 (Ownable)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-173) compliant and use the [OpenSea Filter Registry](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/operator-filter-registry). Along with the base features of 721s and 1155s, you can use a combination of on-chain facets and the SDK to use the following features:

DEV NOTE (JSH): We need to think about how we want to list all our features better. Also, anything we want to be added quickly. There are a few features that are partially finished in other branches we can try to add before publishing.

2. Dynamic NFTs
3. Role-Based Security
