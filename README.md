# ðŸ’Ž Welcome to LivelyDiamond

## LivelyDiamond's Goal

Here is where we explain why we started creating our contracts. We wanted there to be an easy, affordable, modular way for artists to use NFTs to engage with their fans. This can be as technical or light as needed.

## LivelyDiamond's Overview

The LivelyDiamond ecosystem is a collection of on chain smart contracts and web development SDKs to make interacting with them as easy as possible. The smart contracts were built modularly using the [ERC-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) standard. This allows you to only use the features you want, upgrade your contract in the future to use more features, and keep costs down for you as a deployer. We handle all the heavy lifting.
