## LivelyDiamond's Goal

Here is where we explain why we started creating our contracts. We wanted there to be an easy, affordable, modular way for artists to use NFTs to engage with their fans. This can be as technical or light as needed.

Minim veniam exercitation ut nostrud do in consequat pariatur non eiusmod exercitation aliqua et. Do ea veniam magna id. Magna eiusmod ut duis aute voluptate adipisicing adipisicing adipisicing elit. Nisi Lorem in aliqua nostrud ut nulla proident irure excepteur esse anim officia.

## LivelyDiamond's Overview

The LivelyDiamond ecosystem is a collection of on chain smart contracts (LivelyFacets) and web development SDKs to make interacting with them as easy as possible. The smart contracts were built modularly using the [ERC-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) standard. This allows you to only use the features you want, upgrade your contract in the future to use more features, and keep costs down for you as a deployer. We handle all the heavy lifting.

## LivelyDiamond's Features

When you create a LivelyDiamond, you can make it as an ERC-721A collection or an ERC-1155 compliant collection. Both also are [EIP-173 (Ownable)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-173) compliant and use the [OpenSea Filter Registry](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/operator-filter-registry). Along with the base features of 721s and 1155s, you can use a combination of on-chain facets and the SDK to use the following features:
